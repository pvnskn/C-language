# How to install PyLaTeX:

Apply the following prompt in your JuPyter or Google Colab, and pylatex will get installed:

```python
!pip install pylatex
```
After installing pylatex, we also require a latex compiler, for generating latex documents. You can use the following prompt, if your system doesn't have one:

```python
!apt-get install -y texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra
```
